    <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-8">Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>Thank you for using LiteNote! This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal information when you use LiteNote, a text editor application for macOS. By using LiteNote, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>LiteNote is designed to respect your privacy and is intended for use as is. We do not collect any personal data by default when you use the app. However, some minimal information may be collected under certain circumstances:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
      <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> LiteNote does not track or store any usage data unless it involves crash reports or diagnostics related to improving the appâ€™s performance. In such cases, this data is anonymized and does not identify you personally.</li>
      <li><strong>Crash Reports:</strong> If you choose to share crash reports, the data collected may include details about your device and system, but this will be used solely for fixing bugs and improving the app's stability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">2. No Collection of Sensitive Data</h2>
    <p>LiteNote does not access or collect sensitive personal information such as your contacts, files, or location. All the text you create and edit within LiteNote is stored locally on your device unless you choose to store it in third-party cloud services (e.g., iCloud, Dropbox).</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>LiteNote does not integrate with any third-party services that collect or use your personal information. However, if you use external cloud services or storage providers, their privacy policies will apply to any data you choose to save there.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We take data security seriously. LiteNote does not transmit or store your data externally by default, and all your files remain on your device unless you choose otherwise. While no system is completely secure, we have implemented reasonable measures to protect your data from unauthorized access.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">5. User Control and Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>Since LiteNote does not collect or store personal data on its own, there is no specific user account to delete. You control all your text files created in LiteNote, and you can delete them from your device at any time.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If there are any significant changes, we will notify you by posting an update within the app or on our website. Your continued use of LiteNote after any updates indicates your acceptance of the new terms.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">7. No Liability</h2>
    <p>LiteNote TextEditor is provided by an individual ("I" or "Me") and is offered "as is" and "as available." By using LiteNote, you acknowledge and agree that:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
      <li><strong>No Warranties:</strong> I make no warranties or representations of any kind, express or implied, regarding the accuracy, completeness, or availability of the services provided, including, but not limited to, the operation of the app or the website. All services are provided without warranties of any kind.</li>
      <li><strong>Limitation of Liability:</strong> To the fullest extent permitted by law, I will not be held liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages arising out of or in connection with your access or use of, or inability to access or use, LiteNote or related services.</li>
      <li><strong>External Links and Third-Party Content:</strong> LiteNote may contain links to third-party websites or services not controlled by me. I am not responsible for the content or privacy policies of any third-party websites or services.</li>
      <li><strong>Indemnification:</strong> You agree to indemnify and hold me harmless from and against any claims or liabilities arising out of your use of LiteNote or violation of these terms.</li>
    </ul>
